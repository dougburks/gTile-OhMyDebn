# gTile-OhMyDebn
A fork of the Cinnamon gTile window tiling extension for OhMyDebn with additional features

This extension is actually called gTile@OhMyDebn but GitHub doesn't allow the @ symbol. So after cloning, the directory needs to be renamed from gTile-OhMyDebn to gTile@OhMyDebn.

If you're using [OhMyDebn](https://github.com/dougburks/OhMyDebn), then this extension is automatically installed for you.
