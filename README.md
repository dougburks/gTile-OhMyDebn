# gTile-OhMyDebn

This is a fork of the Cinnamon gTile window tiling extension for [OhMyDebn](https://github.com/dougburks/OhMyDebn) with additional features:
- enable window gaps to look more like a traditional tiling window manager
- customize the size of the window gap in settings

This extension is actually called gTile@OhMyDebn but GitHub doesn't allow the @ symbol. So after cloning, the directory needs to be renamed from gTile-OhMyDebn to gTile@OhMyDebn.

If you're using [OhMyDebn](https://github.com/dougburks/OhMyDebn), then this extension is automatically installed for you.
